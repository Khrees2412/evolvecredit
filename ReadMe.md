# The assessment - 48 hrs deadline

## Your mission (should you choose to accept it) is to build a system that manages deposits, savings and withdrawals for a financial institution..

### a. Use case: 
Zeina MFI needs software to manage deposits, savings and withdrawals (all off
the counter without payments automation). They want to be able to
 - i. Accepts deposits from their customers and keep this record
 - ii. Lock a portion of deposits on behalf of the customers for a specified duration
 - iii. Manage withdrawals
 - iv. Keep log of all these transactions
 - v. Transactions should be in accurate sync with customer account balances

### b. 
You may need to create endpoints to set up user accounts & dummy account numbers but
you can also choose to bulk create a few of those in your DB. It is more important for us to
see how you manage ledger, keep balances accurate and keep the system secure. You can
leave comments on what you would do to improve the system if you had more
time/resources.

### c. Task Requirements
i. Convert the problem above to a 1-2 page (backend) technical spec. The
specification should describe how you intend to implement the solution. This
document will change overtime and should be up to date with the latest/final
version of the implementation.
ii. Create a high level process flow (i.e UML) to describe the system you have created.
iii. Write unit tests for the units you consider most critical (your discretion is required
here). We do not care a lot about code coverage, we care more about what you
choose to test and why.
iv. Write integration tests for the modules you consider most critical (your discretion
is required here)
